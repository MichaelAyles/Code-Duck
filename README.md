# CodeDuck ðŸ¦†

A mobile-first AI coding assistant that empowers developers to manage their entire coding workflowâ€”from ideation to commitâ€”directly from their mobile device.

## Overview

CodeDuck leverages AI to accelerate the development process, providing a seamless mobile experience for developers on the go. The app integrates with GitHub and Trello to offer a unified dashboard for managing development tasks, viewing code, and using AI to solve coding challenges.

- **AI-Powered Coding Assistant**: Chat-based interface with commands for code explanation, issue fixes, and code generation

### AI Commands
- `explain file <file_path>`: Get natural language explanations of code
- `propose fix for issue <issue_number>`: AI analyzes issues and proposes patches
- `write code <prompt>`: Generate code from natural language descriptions
